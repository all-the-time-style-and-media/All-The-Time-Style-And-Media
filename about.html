            Leah Z Osborn is majoring in Management: Organizational Leadership and Interactive Digital Studies at the University of Northern Iowa. She chose to attend UNI for its medium-sized campus, low tuition, and amazing business program. She decided on Organizational Leadership as one of her majors because she hopes to own her own business one day and wishes to gain greater knowledge in the business world. Leah chose Interactive Digital Studies as her other major because she has a creative mind and loves working with technology. After college, Leah hopes to work at any company for a couple of years, most likely in marketing or management, and eventually start her own music record label or pursue any ideas that come up!! </p>
